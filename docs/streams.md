# Traffic Streams

Traffic streams allow to do various forwarding verification 
and QoS tests using BNG Blaster.

## Configuration

Following a simple example using streams as described in the
[configuration section](config).

```json

## Stream Configuration File

The command line argument `-T <filename>` allows to include
streams defined from a separate file. The format is equal to
streams defined in the actual configuration file. Such stream
configuration files could be generated by scripts and
easily merged with the base configuration.

```json
{
    "streams": []
}
```

## Check Session Stream Information

The `session-streams` command returns detailed stream statistics per session.

`$ sudo bngblaster-cli run.sock session-streams session-id 1`

            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The `rx-outer-vlan-pbit` might be wrong depending on network interface driver and
optional VLAN offloading.

The measured `rx-delay-nsec-min/max` shows the minimum and maximum calculated delay
in nanosecond. The delay is calculated by subtracting the send and receive timestamp.
The send timestamp is stored in the BBL header (see section Traffic). This calculated
result depends also on the actual test environment, configured rx-interval and host IO
delay.

Traffic streams will start as soon as the session is established using the rate as configured
starting with sequence number 1 for each flow. The attribute `rx-first-seq` stores the first
sequence number received. Assuming the first sequence number received for given flow is 1000
combined with a rate of 1000 PPS would mean that it took around 1 second until forwarding is
working. After first packet is received for a given flow, for every further packet it checks
if there is a gap between last and new sequence number which is than reported as loss.

The `rx/tx-accounting-packets` are all packets which should be counted in the session volume
accounting of the BNG, meaning session rx/tx packets excluding control traffic.

Each flow can be queried separately using jsonpath expression with name and direction or flow-id.

`$ sudo bngblaster-cli run.sock session-streams session-id 1 | jq '."session-streams".streams[] | select(.name == "BE" and .direction == "downstream" )'`

```json
{
  "name": "BE",
  "direction": "downstream",
  "flow-id": 2,
  "rx-first-seq": 33,
  "rx-last-seq": 27040,
  "rx-tos-tc": 213,
  "rx-outer-vlan-pbit": 0,
  "rx-inner-vlan-pbit": 0,

  "rx-mbps-l2": 0.099792,
  "rx-mbps-l3": 0.0792
}
```

## RAW Streams

Streams with default `stream-group-id` set to zero are considered as raw streams not
bound to any session which is supported in downstream only. For those streams the
destination address must be explicitly set.

RAW streams can be used for traffic between two or network interfaces but also to send traffic
from network to access interfaces.

```json
{
    "streams": [
        {
            "name": "RAW",
            "type": "ipv4",
            "direction": "downstream",
            "priority": 128,
            "network-ipv4-address": "10.0.0.20",
            "destination-ipv4-address": "1.1.1.1",
            "length": 256,
            "pps": 1
        }
    ]
}
```

If `destination-ipv4-address` is set to a multicast IP address (224.0.0.0 - 239.255.255.255),
the BNG Blaster will set the the destination MAC address to the corresponding
multicast MAC address automatically. For unicast traffic the network gateway MAC address is used.

## Threaded Streams

With threading enabled, those streams will be started per default in a dedicated thread per flow.
This means one thread per session and stream direction. A threaded, bidirectional stream assigned
to 10 sessions will therefore run in 20 threads. It is also possible to assign multiple
steams to a single thread using thread groups.

In most environments we see between 200.000 and 300.000 PPS single threaded is working. Depending
on actual setup this can be also much more. With threaded streams we are also able to scale up to
10 million PPS depending on actual configuration and setup. This allows to start 1 million flows
with 1 PPS per flow over 4 threads in example to verify all prefixes of a BGP full table.

The BNG Blaster is currently tested for up to 1 million flows which is not a hard limitation but
everything above should be considered as experimental.

```json
{
    "streams": [
        {
            "name": "RAW1",
            "type": "ipv4",
            "direction": "downstream",
            "priority": 128,
            "destination-ipv4-address": "10.0.0.1",
            "length": 256,
            "pps": 100000,
            "network-interface": "eth1",
            "threaded": true,
            "thread-group": 1
        },
        {
            "name": "RAW2",
            "type": "ipv4",
            "direction": "downstream",
            "priority": 128,
            "destination-ipv4-address": "10.0.0.1",
            "length": 256,
            "pps": 100000,
            "network-interface": "etg1",
            "threaded": true,
            "thread-group": 2
        }
    ]
}
```

## Start/Stop Session Stream Traffic

Session stream traffic can be started/stopped dynamically
using the commands `stream-traffic-enabled` and `stream-traffic-disabled`.

`$ sudo bngblaster-cli run.sock stream-traffic-disabled session-id 1`

Those commands start/stop the traffic for all sessions if invoked without
session identifier.

`$ sudo bngblaster-cli run.sock stream-traffic-disabled`

Alternatively all session and stream traffic (including RAW streams)
can be started or stopped globally using the `traffic-start` and
`traffic-stop` commands.
